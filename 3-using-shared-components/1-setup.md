# Setup

In this lesson, we need a simple Next.js app to play with. Try downloading the following example app:

```
git clone https://github.com/arunoda/learnnextjs-demo.git
cd learnnextjs-demo
git checkout navigate-between-pages
```

You can run it with:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000.
