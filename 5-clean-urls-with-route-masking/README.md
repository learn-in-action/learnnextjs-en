# Clean URLs with Route Masking

In the previous lesson, we learned how to create dynamic pages with query strings.
With that, a link to one of our blog posts looks like this:

http://localhost:3000/post?title=Hello%20Next.js

But that URL doesn't look nice.
How about if we had something like this?

http://localhost:3000/p/hello-nextjs

It would be awesome, right?

That's exactly what we are trying to do with this lesson.
