# 404

It gives us a 404 error. That's because there is no such page to load on the server.
The server will try to load the page `p/hello-nextjs`, but we only have two pages: `index.js` and `post.js`.

With this, we can't run this app in production. We need to fix this.

**Next.js's [custom server API](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#custom-server-and-routing) is the solution for this problem.**

We are going to learn how to use it in the next lesson.
