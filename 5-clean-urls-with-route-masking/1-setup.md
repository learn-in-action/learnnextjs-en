# Setup

First of all, we need a simple Next.js app to play with. Try to download the following example app:

```
git clone https://github.com/arunoda/learnnextjs-demo.git
cd learnnextjs-demo
git checkout create-dynamic-pages
```

You can run it with:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000/.
