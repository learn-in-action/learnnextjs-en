# Setup

First of all, we need a simple Next.js app to play with. Try to download the following example app:

```
  git clone https://github.com/arunoda/learnnextjs-demo.git
  cd learnnextjs-demo
  git checkout clean-urls
```

You can run it with:

```
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

Now you can access the app by navigating into http://localhost:3000.
