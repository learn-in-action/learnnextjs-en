# Finally

Here we've simply created a route using Next.js custom server API. With that, we've added server side support for clean URLs. Just like this, you can create as many routes as you want.

You're not limited to using [Express](https://expressjs.com/). You can use any Node.js server framework for that. You can also look at the Next.js documentation for the [custom server API](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#custom-server-and-routing).
