# Setup

In order to follow along with this lesson, you need to have a simple Next.js app. For that, continue your work from the previous lesson or download the following example app:

```
git clone https://github.com/arunoda/learnnextjs-demo.git
cd learnnextjs-demo
git checkout getting-started
```

You can run it with:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000/.
